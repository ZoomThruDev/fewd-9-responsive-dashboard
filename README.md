# fewd-9-responsive-dashboard
attempting to recreate a responsive dashboard with fancy charts and stuff

- used Sass for thsi project. Makes styling the CSS so so much easier..
- the chart library used is Charts.js
- time taken is about ~1 week due to me being stuck at certain parts like how to swap datasets around and trying to make the canvas more responsive. Also refining lots of small details
- tested in: Safari Version 9.1.1 (10601.6.17), Chrome Version 50.0.2661.102 (64-bit) and Firefox Version 46.0.1

Notes:
- Should cater for every (as in literally EVERY) screensizes possible, including the 4k ones (2560px). A graceful way to do it is to align main container in the center and set a nice max-width e.g. at 1440px or so.
